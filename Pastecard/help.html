	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Pastecard is a small, single page for notes. You can add to, edit, or completely erase it however you like. It&rsquo;s like the digital version of writing on the back of your hand. Try it for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shopping lists</li>
		<li>To-dos and reminders</li>
		<li>Navigation directions</li>
		<li>Links to view later</li>
		<li>Contact information</li>
		<li>and more!</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>To <strong>sign up</strong>, fill out the form on the sign up page.</li>
		<li>To see your Pastecard, just go to your Pastecard URL. No login required!</li>
		<li>To <strong>install Pastecard on iOS</strong>, go to your Pastecard URL in Safari and tap the share icon in the bottom toolbar. Choose &ldquo;Add to Homescreen&rdquo; and tap the Done button. (Requires iOS 11.3 or newer)</li>
		<li>To <strong>install Pastecard on Android</strong>, go to your Pastecard URL in Chrome and tap the menu icon at the upper right. Choose &ldquo;Add to home screen&rdquo; and tap the Add button. (Requires Android 6.0 Marshmallow or newer)</li>
		<li>To <strong>install Pastecard on a Mac</strong>, go to your Pastecard URL in Safari and choose &ldquo;Add to Dock&hellip;&rdquo; from the File menu. (Requires macOS 14.0 Sonoma or newer)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Using Pastecard</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Go to your Pastecard URL to see your saved text in a readable card view.</li>
		<li>Click or tap on the card to make it editable, and you can make changes or copy text to your clipboard.</li>
		<li>Once you&rsquo;re done editing, click or tap &ldquo;Save&rdquo; to save your changes permanently, or &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; to discard your changes. Either button will return you to the card view.</li>
		<li>If you install Pastecard to your home screen and launch it when your device has no WiFi or cellular connection, Pastecard will attempt to display the last-saved version of your text in an <strong>offline read-only mode</strong>.</li>
		<li>Under read-only mode, you won&rsquo;t be able to make any edits until you relaunch the app under an active connection.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="app">iPhone App</h2>
	<p>For an enhanced iPhone experience, get the official Pastecard app from the App Store.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Tap</strong> the card area to edit your text.</li>
		<li><strong>Swipe up</strong> on the card area to force a refresh, share your card text to another app, sign out, or delete your account.</li>
		<li>If you open Pastecard when your device has no WiFi or cellular connection, the app will attempt to display the last-saved version of your text in an <strong>offline read-only mode</strong>.</li>
		<li>Easily append the current web page URL or any selected text to your card from the Share menu.</li>
		<li>Add the widget to your home screen to see your card text without opening the app. The widget refreshes every time the main app successfully loads from or saves to the cloud.</li>
		<li>Ask Siri to &ldquo;Add something to my Pastecard&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on my Pastecard?&rdquo;</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Pastecard does not use passwords: <strong>if someone knows your Pastecard URL, they have the same access you do.</strong> Please don&rsquo;t use Pastecard for any sensitive information.</li>
		<li>If you&rsquo;re concerned about privacy, we recommend choosing an ID that you don&rsquo;t use anywhere else.</li>
		<li>Only the current version of your Pastecard is saved. There is no way to undo or recover old text.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="tos">Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h2>
	<p>By using Pastecard, you accept and agree with the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The only data Pastecard explicitly collects from you is your ID and your card text. We never share this with anybody.</li>
		<li>However, there are no passwords. Anyone can view and/or edit your Pastecard if they know your ID. Pastecard does not claim responsibility for the privacy nor the security of your card text.</li>
		<li>As a web app, standard usage information like time stamps and your IP address is logged. We do nothing with this information.</li>
		<li>We may modify the service from time to time, hopefully always to make it better.</li>
		<li>We will delete your account and/or restrict your access if you use it in a bad way. We reserve the right to define what those bad ways are.</li>
