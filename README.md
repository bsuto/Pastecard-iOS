# Pastecard for iOS & iPadOS

This is an experimental native app for [Pastecard](https://pastecard.net). It requires iOS or iPadOS 14 or later and is not guaranteed to always work or even be that nice.

## What are the benefits of this app over the web app?
* Home screen widgets that show your card text
* Share extensions to append the current URL or selected text
* Take advantage of multitasking on iPad
* All the warm feelings of a real native app

## A few notes:
* This app will go into the same __read-only mode__ as the web app when there's no internet connection
* __Swipe up__ on the card to force a refresh, share the entire card contents to another app, or sign out
* See [Pastecard Help](https://pastecard.net/help/) for more information
