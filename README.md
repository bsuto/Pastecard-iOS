# Pastecard for iPhone

* Home screen widgets that show your card text
* Share extensions to append the current URL or selected text
* Available and extensible through Siri and Shortcuts
* __Swipe up__ on the card to force a refresh, share the card text to another app, or sign out
* All the warm feelings of a native SwiftUI app

## A few notes
* iOS 17 or later required
* __This repo is incomplete__
  * There is a missing PastecardCore Swift package that includes core logic and API routes
  * The rest of the app is here for reference
