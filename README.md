# Pastecard for iOS

This is an experimental native app for [Pastecard](http://pastecard.net), written in Swift 4. It requires iOS 11.2 or later, is intended for iPhones only (no iPads), and is not guaranteed to always work or even be that nice.

Create a new project in Xcode, add all the files from this repository, and follow [Apple's instructions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/TestingYouriOSApp/TestingYouriOSApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH8-SW9) for installing the app on your own device. 

A few notes:
* The iOS app will go into the same __read-only mode__ as the web app when there's no internet connection.
* __Swipe up__ in the main view to force a refresh or sign out.
* See [Pastecard Help](http://pastecard.net/help/) for more information.
