# Pastecard for iOS

This is an experimental native app for [Pastecard](https://pastecard.net). It requires iOS 11 or later and is not guaranteed to always work or even be that nice.

## What are the benefits of this app over the web app?
* Take advantage of multitasking on iPad
* A share extension to append the current URL or selected text to your Pastecard
* All the warm feelings of a true native app

## A few notes:
* The iOS app will go into the same __read-only mode__ as the web app when there's no internet connection
* __Swipe up__ on the card to force a refresh, share the entire card contents to another app, or sign out
* See [Pastecard Help](https://pastecard.net/help/) for more information
